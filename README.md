## Project Name & Pitch

Lendsqr Frontend app

This dashboard will use a mock API to display user information in well designed format, built with React, React Context, Typescript, and SCSS.

## Project Status
The project is effectively complete but may involve more improvements. Users can login and see a full list of users as well as their respective details. Functionality to sort by additional parameters is in progress.

## Reflection

This was a 6 day long project built as a requirement for the Lendsqr recruitment process. Project goals included using React, typescript and SCSS.

For now, the login page does not really have functionality. Simply click the "LOG IN" button and you will be navigated to the dashboard page.

On the side you will be able to navigate to the users page by clicking on users. In order to open the user details page, you can simply click on their username. You can then navigate back to the users page by click on "Back to users"
